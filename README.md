## About
My first proxy-related project, just getting to know how proxy sites work.

## Note:
I do not reccommend Koyeb as a production hosting service because its server IP range/network has been blacklisted by youtube, when trying to host a proxy on koyeb be mindful that videos will not be able to be watched, instead a message saying "sign in to confirm you're not a bot" will appear, this issue so far has proven unsolvable.

## Features
- Stunning design
- Support many popular sites
- Mobile support
- about:blank cloaking
- Clickoff cloaking

## Setup
### Run
Run `npm start` to start a webserver and the Bare server. You may deploy this by using an external bare server and a static file host. It must be built before attempting to start.

### Build
Run `npm run build` to build app for production to the `build` folder.

### Development
Run `npm run dev` to run the app in development mode.

### Deploy
Click a button at the top of this page and follow the directions for an easy way to host this if you reall want to. (not reccomended)
